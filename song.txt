I feel your head resting heavy on your single bed
I want to hear all about it, get it all off your chest, oh
I feel the tears, and you're not alone, oh
When I hold you, well, I won't let go, oh

Why should we care for what they're selling us anyway?
We're so younger than you know, whoa
You don't have to be there, babe
You don't have to be scared, babe
You don't need a plan of what you wanna do
Won't you listen to the man that's loving you?


Your world keeps spinning and you can't jump off
But I will catch you if you fall, I can't tell you enough
I hate to hear that you're feeling low
I hate to hear that you won't come home
